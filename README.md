Hi, 

The following .ipynb file is the solution to the problem you posted on Twitter. 

The .ipynb does not display the results on github. This is because I purposefully exported the file before producing any output so that I can limit the uploadable file size.

So please download the file and run it on your jupyter notebook or a personal machine to see the results.

To download some of the libraries, please type the command below on your notebook cell. Otherwise, you can just exclude the leading exclamation mark and run the rest on termminal.

!pip install dtale

!pip install pandas

!pip install cufflinks

I rendered the results to the best of my understanding of your written proposal. 

So if there are some aspects in the results you want me to modify, please let me know.

David
